<!--Please note that blood has a shelf life. It is important that there is proper monitoring of the stock of blood. The idea of AAROGYA of course is to ensure that nobody suffers due to non-availability of blood. At the same time it would be criminal to have more blood than what is required and then have it go down the drain. Therefore please do not seek blood from Hyderabad Blood Donors without doing the following:- 

If there is anyone in need of blood : 

a.) Ask the hospital to contact other blood banks in the city

b.) Ask the hospital to contact the State Blood Transfusion Council really speaking, if there is a need for blood it only means that the concerned hospital has absolved itself of the responsibility of organizing blood and pushed the onus on to the hapless patient. It would also be appropriate to check if blood has already been given to the patient, and the hospital is seeking replacement, in which case there is no real emergency. It is most likely that you would be called in by someone to be a replacement donor. It would be really commendable if you donate blood as a replacement donor because your blood will be used in future emergencies and you will make the blood cheaper by a few thousands (ranging from Rs. 800 to Rs. 10,000) for the person who called you. It is not uncommon knowledge that medical aid comes for a heavy price and your contribution as a replacement donor can actually save somebody’s life by making the whole treatment affordable for him/her. Hyderabad Blood Donors maintains a database of blood donors and categorizes them on the basis of blood group and location. Also, contact details of the donor are required to ensure timely service. Registration is the only way of acquiring this information from people who willingly want to support our cause by registering themselves as donors. Due to the nature of its service, Hyderabad Blood Donors requires to furnish the seeker with phone numbers & e-mail address (if he had it) of blood donors. During individual emergencies, phone is the easiest way of contacting someone while during social emergencies when cellular communications break down, the internet still can be used for requesting blood. Hence, the need for giving out contact details

Hyderabad Blood Donors does not sell contact details to any third party or use it in any way for commercial gains. The contact details (e-mail address and phone number) of the voluntary blood donor are made available in an automated way without any discrimination or charge to anybody who seeks donors for a particular blood group in a particular region. Hyderabad Blood Donors is a website in the public domain and is accessible to any person with an internet connection. Because of this any person or blood bank who seeks blood can obtain your contact details from the website and contact you. It is not at all compulsory to donate blood when called upon. The donor can turn down any request to donate blood if he does not wish to do so. Hyderabad Blood Donors is just a directory of people who “wish” to donate blood free of cost. Hence, it is advisable that you do not register yourself if you “never” plan to donate blood You will not be paid in anyway for donating blood. Your service will be completely voluntary and for a social cause. Donating blood for money or any commercial gain is banned by the law in India from January 1, 1996. (Source: Frontline, Volume 22 - Issue 14, Jul 02 - 15, 2005). Donors are requested to inform the seekers that they are donating voluntarily and no money should be given to any person or agent for the same.
